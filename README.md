## medicine-reminder-telegram-chatbot
A useful chatbot that reminds you when it is time to take that pill.

Made in 2017, this is one of my first Telegram Bots.

It was my initial steps with HTTP based APIs using JavaScript. 

Code might not be very clean and I removed bot keys and my user references like ids and e-mail.

## The problem solved
This chatbot sends a message to a telegram group to remind that it is time to take that pill. I coded it to help me and my siblings so we can remember mom's to never forget to take her everyday medicine. Any group member can click the confirmation button, as you can see in the image below.
