## medicine-reminder-telegram-chatbot
A useful chatbot that reminds you when it is time to take that pill. This is one of many Telegram Bot I created.

Made in 2019, this is one of my first chatbots. To publish the project here on GitHub I removed the bot keys and users references like ids and e-mails.

## Techs
- Google Apps Script (web apps, triggers and more)
- JavaScript
- Google Sheets (store messages)
- Telegram Bot API

## The problem solved
A very common mistake people make everyday is to forget to take regular medicines, especially when elderly.

This chatbot sends a message to a telegram group so you don't forget that it is time to take that pill. I coded it to help me and my siblings reminding our mother to take her everyday medicine. Any group member can click on the confirmation button, as you can see in the image below.
