## medicine-reminder-telegram-chatbot
A useful chatbot that reminds you when it is time to take that pill.

Made in 2017, this is one of my first Telegram Bots. I was taking my first steps with HTTP based APIs using JavaScript and Google Apps Script so code might not be very clean. To publish here on GitHub I removed bot keys and users references like ids and e-mail.

## Techs
- Google Apps Script
- JavaScript
- Google Sheets
- Telegram Bot API

## The problem solved
A very common mistake people make everyday is to forget to take regular medicines. Especially when elderly.

This chatbot sends a message to a telegram group to remind that it is time to take that pill. I coded it to help me and my siblings so we can remember mom's to never forget to take her everyday medicine. Any group member can click the confirmation button, as you can see in the image below.
